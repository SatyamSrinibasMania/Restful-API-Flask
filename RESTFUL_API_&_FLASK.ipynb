        "- **Why Flask is Popular for Building APIs :**\n",
        "\n",
        " - **Simplicity and Minimalism :** Flask has a minimalistic design, making it easy for developers to quickly build and deploy APIs. It doesn’t impose any boilerplate or heavy structure, so we can focus on the core logic of our API without unnecessary overhead.\n",
        "\n",
        " - **Flexibility :** Flask gives developers the freedom to add only the components they need, such as database support or authentication. It's not opinionated about how we should structure our application, allowing for more flexibility.\n",

        " - **RESTful API Support :** Flask makes it simple to create RESTful APIs using routes and HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). We can easily handle requests and return responses in JSON format, making it ideal for building modern web APIs.\n",
        "\n",
        " - **Great for Prototypes and Small to Medium Apps :** Due to its minimalistic design, Flask is perfect for quickly prototyping ideas and building small to medium-sized applications. It's also highly suited for microservices-based architectures, where we need lightweight, individual services.\n",

        "- In Flask, **blueprints** are a way to organize our application into modular components. A blueprint in Flask allows us to group related views, templates, static files, and other resources together, making our application more structured and maintainable. We can think of blueprints as a way to break down a large Flask application into smaller, more manageable parts.\n",
        "\n",
        "- A **blueprint** defines a set of routes, views, templates, and other associated functionality that can be registered in the main Flask application. By using blueprints, we can organize our application into distinct modules, each representing a particular feature or section of the app.\n",
